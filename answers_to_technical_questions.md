Answers to technical questions:

1. I spent the full 72 hours on the coding test due to my inexperience of working with Angular. Because this was my first time using Angular I used all the available time to develop the UI and behaviour and I hasn't hable to create tests. If I had more time I hould create the tests for the buttons, check if the array .Restaurants was returning data and checked if the data was being shown on the screen. After that I would create an individual page for each restaurant where i would display some images, the working schedule and links for: see menu, start an order, get directions or call to the restaurant.

2. My choosen programming language is JavaScript and the most useful feature that was added to its latest version were the let keyword, arrow functions, classes and promises. Many features in Angular were similar to JS, but some things were new to me and I consider this framework very straightforward when I started to understand it better. 

3. I never had to track down a performance issue in production, but if I had to do it I hould use the developer tools available on the browser. Depending on the problem I hould use the different resources like sources to check the values of some variable at a different times or the network/performance to check for how much time a file hould load. There could be different problems that could afect the website in production, so using the logs of the server or other related indicator could facilitate finding the problem.


Thank you for the opportunity to make the coding test and for the interview!
